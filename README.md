# Manga tracker 
I am making as a personal project to store a private database on a localhost through xampp to input manga I've read with photo's of them and small descriptions!
---
### Non-Functional Requirements
* The system should be able to handle multiple things in the database
* The system should load and display manga listings within an acceptable response time for a small dataset.
* prepare statements when connecting to prevent sql injection
* friendly layout,with clear labeling, (inspired layout by my anime list in colorscheme and font)
* Sliding css applied view of manga in database
* Background image of my chosen favorite manga (JJK)
* friendly gui with sidebar that scales to upper screen for mobile(haven't tested yet..)
  ### (UPDATE IDEAS FOR 0.3)
  * comments under manga databases
  * user favorites(user customization for backgrounds via their favorite)
  * friend system
  * messaging mechanism between users!

  

### Functional Requirements
* Store books I've read
* Upload images and descriptions for each manga
* Be able to view finished uploads of manga
* Search for names through database
* edit manga from the list, delete from list
  ### (UPDATED AFTER 0.2)
  * Search for usernames through database
  * Settings
  * Account management details
  * Password hashing
