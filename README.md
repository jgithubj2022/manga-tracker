# manga-tracker
---
Manga tracker I am making as a personal project to store a private database on a localhost through xampp to input manga I've read with photo's of them and small descriptions!
---
### Non-Functional Requirements
* The system should be able to handle multiple things in the database
* The system should load and display manga listings within an acceptable response time for a small dataset.
* prepare statements when connecting to prevent sql injection
* friendly layout,with clear labeling, (inspired layout by my anime list in colorscheme and font)
* Sliding css applied view of manga in database
* Background image of my chosen favorite manga (JJK)
* friendly gui with sidebar that scales to upper screen for mobile(haven't tested yet..)

  

### Functional Requirements
* Store books I've read
* Upload images and descriptions for each manga
* Be able to view finished uploads of manga
* Search for names through database
* edit manga from the list, delete from list
### (UPDATED AFTER 0.2)
* Search for usernames through database
* Settings
* Account management details
* Password hashing
